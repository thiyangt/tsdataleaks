Comment 1:

**If there are references describing the methods in your package, please
add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
or if those are not available: <https:...>
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for
auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in
quotes: "Title")**

I do  not have these urls yet. But I have added URL and BugReports into the description

Comment 2:

**Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files to illustrate the
use of the exported function but also enable automatic testing.**

I have added small executable examples
